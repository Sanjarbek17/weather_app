# weather_app

A new Flutter project.

## Description

This is a weather app that uses the Visual Crossing weather API to get the weather data for a given city. The app uses the `flutter_provider` to manage the state of the app. The app also uses the http package to make the API calls. 
I have also used custom_pain widget to draw shapes that cannot be drawn using the default widgets.
